# The Weekender Unofficial HD Remaster

Unofficial proof-of-concept modern update for MTA's Weekender. http://web.mta.info/weekender/

## Goals

- **Responsive.** Expands to use as much screen real estate as possible, and will work on mobile devices, too.
- **Resolution-independent.** Renders crisply at any pixel density: Retina, 4K, etc.
- **Performant.** Interactions occur instantaneously, without a full page reload. Also deep-linkable.
- **Accessible.** Built in accordance with web accessibility best practices for people with disabilities.
- **Standards-compliant.** Alert data is converted to standard data format, e.g. Open311.
- **Open source.** Anyone can view or propose updates to the code.
- **Everyone grows up sometime.** We can't be weekend warriors forever. We'll need alerts the rest of the week, too.

## Status

### ✅ Achieved!
- **Resolution-independent**
- **Performant**
- **Open source**

### ⏳ In progress

### ❌ Haven't started!

- **Standards-compliant:** data is used as is, rather than converted to a standard format.
- **Everyone grows up sometime:** still just weekend data only! needs real-time and daily status alerts!
